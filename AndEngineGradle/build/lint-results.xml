        summary="Issues related to running lint itself, such as failure to read files, etc"
        explanation="This issue type represents a problem running lint itself. Examples include failure to find bytecode for source files (which means certain detectors could not be run), parsing errors in lint configuration files, etc.
These errors are not errors in your own code, but they are shown to make it clear that some checks were not completed.">

        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Checks that the manifest specifies a targetSdkVersion that is recent"
        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly.

        summary="Checks that various manifest elements are declared in the right place"
        explanation="The `&lt;uses-library>` element should be defined as a direct child of the `&lt;application>` tag, not the `&lt;manifest>` tag or an `&lt;activity>` tag. Similarly, a `&lt;uses-sdk>` tag much be declared at the root level, and so on.
